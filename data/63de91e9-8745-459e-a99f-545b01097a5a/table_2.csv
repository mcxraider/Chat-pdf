(1) Tea bag bloats and floats on top of the water when boiling water is poured directly on top of it. (2) Tea bag doesnâ€™t bloat and sinks in the water when boiling water is poured on the side and not directly onto it.,"Water poured on top of the tea bag fills the pores of the teabag itself, trapping any gas inside before it can escape. The hot water heats the trapped air, causing it to expand. The trapped air prevents the tea bag from being dunked. Pores of the tea bag can get sealed up with water and prevent air from escaping.","Quickly seal the tea bag in cold water, trapping the air, then pour boiling water near to but not directly onto it.",Tea bag bloats and floats on top of the water supporting the explanation.

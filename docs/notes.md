# Goals:
- Release a version that supports at least 20 users by the end of summer


# TODOs:
- Check that pipeline works well (can try running on lukes computer)
- (feat): Improve the enhance query function. 
  - What I wanna do is to improve the retrieval across the pdf. 
  - So since the query is going to be hybridly retrieved, i can have multiple sections of the query be further split,
then multiple queries will be done to the pinecone vector db for more distinguised context

- (feat): Implement chat function distinction (whether to use normal chat or rag pipeline)
- (feat): Develop gradio platform to simulate the frontend first
